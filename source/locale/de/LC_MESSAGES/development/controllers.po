"Controllers are - in a MVC model - in charge of make relation between an URL "
"and Objects that does the job behind the scenes. Since Galette uses Slim "
"Framework, we've used anonymous functions in routes; but that makes all that "
"code not reusable; therefore there were plenty of code that was very similar "
"in several places."
